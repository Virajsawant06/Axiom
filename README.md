# Axiom - Developer Social Platform & Hackathon Hub

## Introduction üèÜ  
Axiom was built following my experience as a hackathon participant in the **World‚Äôs Largest Hackathon**, presented by [Bolt](https://bolt.new). This global AI-powered hackathon, hosted online from **May 30 to June 30, 2025**, offered over **US‚ÄØ$1,037,500** in prizes, including top awards of **$100,000**, **$75,000**, **$50,000**, down to **$10,000**, plus regional and bonus categories   
Participants built applications primarily using Bolt.new (with mandatory ‚ÄúBuilt with Bolt.new‚Äù badges), across various challenge tracks ‚Äì AI, blockchain, monetization, voice/video, and even whimsical ‚ÄúSilly Sh!t‚Äù apps.  
The event spanned multiple global regions (AMER, APAC, EMEA), featured judge panels of industry leaders, and closed with winners announced around **July 26, 2025** .
